## Documentaion

Implementation:
Each instance of the service holds a map, each map item consists of key=task id and value=task data.

Listing all tasks will return a map, each pair consist of (id, task). The id is needed in order to remove a task when needed.

When createing a task, a uuid is generated and the task is inserted to the map holding all tasks. In addition the service that recived the request send a request to the other service/services with the data of the new task to add.

Similarly, when removeing a task, the task is removed from the map, and the service that recived the request send a request to the other service/services with the id of the task to remove.
Notice: in order to remove a task, first list all tasks, extract the id of the relevant task, then request to remove the task with the relvant id.
